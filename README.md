# What reddit.uno *is not*

* Allowing you to login and create posts/comments. This app is a read-only reddit app. If you want to login to a reddit account, we suggest you download a reddit app on your phone.
* Replacement to desktop `reddit.com`. It's only the mobile website that's broken. That's what this replaces. The site may not look good on desktop. It's advised that you use this site only for mobile viewing.
